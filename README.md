# Playbook

DevSecOps functions require coordination and alignment to support building secure software, scalable detection and immediate response.  To support this capability, a Playbook provides the guidance necessary and eventually migrates to automated support.  This project is meant to provide a Playbook lifecycle and the automation for migrating from test activities to machine triggered response.
