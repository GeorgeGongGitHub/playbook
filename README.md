# Playbook

The DevSecOps playbook is a collection of processes, roles and tools that help with securing the Software Supply Chain.  DevSecOps is a collection of functions that require coordination and alignment to support building secure software, scalable detection and immediate response.  To support this capability, a Playbook provides the guidance necessary and eventually migrates to automated support.  This project is meant to provide a Playbook lifecycle and the automation for migrating from test activities to machine triggered response.
