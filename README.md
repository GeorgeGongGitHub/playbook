# Playbook

The DevSecOps playbook is a collection of processes, roles and tools that help with securing the Software Supply Chain.  DevSecOps is a collection of functions that require coordination and alignment to support building secure software, scalable detection and immediate response.  To support this capability, a Playbook provides the guidance necessary and eventually migrates to automated support. We consider this an evolutionary document which is being translated into code.  It is intended to being a living document that will constantly change. 

Additionally, the embodiment of this project is to provide a Playbook lifecycle and the automation for migrating from test activities to machine triggered response.  We will use manual steps when necessary, existing tools and developed code as necessary to improve and mature DevSecOps as we learn.
